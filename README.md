# Road Accident Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)

## Project Objective:
To analyze road accident data for the years 2024–2025, focusing on:Year-over-Year (YOY) comparison of casualties and accidents
Identifying key contributing factors like weather, driver behavior, and vehicle typeUnderstanding the distribution of accidents across urban vs rural areas
Measuring police response time efficiency

-Fatal Casualties: 169 (↓3%)

-Major Casualties: 166 (↑52%)

-Minor Casualties: 169 (↑22%)

-Average Police Response Time: 22.7 minutes

-Rural Areas accounted for 53% of total casualties.

-Top Causes: Overspeeding, Drunk Driving, and Poor Visibility.

-Bike and Truck accidents were the most frequent vehicle types involved.

## 🧠 Conclusion:

This analysis highlights a concerning increase in road accidents, especially in rural regions. Overspeeding and drunk driving remain the leading causes of casualties. The dashboard helps in understanding trends and can assist policymakers in implementing stricter safety regulations and awareness programs to minimize accidents.
